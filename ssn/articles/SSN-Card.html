          version of the SSN card includes additional security features. Some of the 
          more recognizable features are:</P>
            A unique non-repeating spiral design, replacing the existing 
                  marbleized pattern. The new pattern will be the same or a very similar 
                  color to the current background and will continue to be 
                  erasable.<br><br>
                  
                  Color shifting inks added to the face of the card; very recognizable 
                  since it is used in currency.<br><br>
                  
                  A latent image on the face of the card, visible only when the 
                  document is viewed at specific 
                  angles.<br><br>

                  Latent images that can be seen when the card is viewed at an angle.<Br><br>
Color shifting ink (similar to that used on $20 bills) that changes colors when the card is viewed from different angles.<br><br>
A new production method that blends different color inks on the background of the card (colors flow from blue to aqua).<br><br>
Adding issuance date to the front of the card.<br><br>
Other features added to the card are not apparent to the naked eye and for security reasons are not disclosed to the public.<br><br>

Another change made to the Social Security card in 2007 was to put the first name and last name of the card holder on separate lines. This change was recommended by employer groups to help them distinguish the correct last name of an employee.
